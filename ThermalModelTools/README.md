# Thermal Model Tools
## Description

## Last Updated: 30 September 2025

This folder contains various example tools that can be used in tandem with the thermal conductivity data stored in this repository. The tools allow the user to create 'thermal models' of cryogenic systems. 

### Excel Thermal Models
Within the `Excel_Notebooks` folder, you will find example thermal models that have been made using Microsoft Excel and Excel Macros written in Visual Basic for Applications. 

The `ExampleThermalModel` notebook is a barebones example that provides a short tutorial for how to adapt the file to your own, more complex systems. 

The `Bluefors_LD400` file contains the thermal model of a standard Bluefors LD400 Dilution Refrigerator system (based on a system installed at the University of Texas). This serves as an example thermal model of a realistic system. 

### Python Models
This repository also contains some tools developed in Python. Both are provided as there do exist benefits to both the Excel Models and these Python models.
