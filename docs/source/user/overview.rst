Overview
=============

This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive and transparent database of cryogenic material properties, with a focus on thermal conductivity. The goal is to create a resource that can be used by researchers in experimental cosmology and other fields requiring precise material property data at cryogenic temperatures.
The repository includes raw data, fitting methods, and tools for analyzing and utilizing this data. It is intended to be a living document that can be updated as new data becomes available or as scientific needs evolve.

Goals and Motivation
````````````````````
- **Data:** Compile and house a repository of cryogenic material data (beginning with thermal conductivity and eventually expanding to other desired properties)
- **Fitting:** Develop a method of fitting data to produce high quality, adaptable fits which can be used for calculations. And store fits created by others for materials for which raw data is not available.
- **Transparency:** Produce a transparent database that saves references to data and clearly shows and explains how fits are procured.
- **Tools:** Provide example tools demonstrating the operation of the pipeline output in scientific applications.
- **Versatility:** Develop a pipeline that can be easily updated by users as new data is added, or changed depending on specific scientific goals.

About Us and Contact
````````

This repository was created in support of the mission of the CMB-S4 collaboration. It is designed primarily with the desires and experiences of researchers in experimental cosmology in mind. However, it is the hope of the developers that this repository can serve as a useful tool for scientists and researchers in a wide range of fields beyond our own. As such, we encourage any user who may wish to contribute their own expertise to get in contact with us to help further develop this repository.
