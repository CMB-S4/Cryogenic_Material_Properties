Getting Started
===============

For those who wish to update the *thermal_conductivity_compilation* files, add local data, or manipulate the fits and code in any way, it is recommended to make a clone of this repository.

Currently, the amount of raw data and fit plots is sufficiently low to keep the total storage size of the repository to a reasonable download size. There is work being done to eliminate the need to download all the raw data as the repository expands in size and scope.
