Referencing and Fit Sources
===========================

A major goal of this repository transparency everywhere possible. To this end, every fit and every dataset held within the repo is referenced using a simple Title, Author, Journal, Year method. 
To find the references, please navigate to the material of interest. Depending on the material and the number of available fits, there may be multiple folders within the material directory. Upon selecting a subdirectory
such as RAW, NIST, or OTHER, the reference information is stored within the reference.txt file.
