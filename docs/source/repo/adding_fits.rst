Adding Fits
============================

Adding a fit (without adding data) is done by adding a ``Fit`` object to the list of fits attributed to a ``Material`` object.

#. Load the material instance (from the corresponding ``.pkl`` file) using the following code.
#. Create a new ``Fit`` object.
#. Append the new ``Fit`` object to the list of fits attributed to the ``Material`` object.
#. Save the updated ``Material`` object back to the ``.pkl`` file.
