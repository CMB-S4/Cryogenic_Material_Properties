Tutorials
============

The object oriented structure of the repository can be daunting at first. To help new users get started, a tutorial notebook has been provided. 
This notebook walks through the basic functionality of the repository, including how to load data, create material objects, and access fits. The tutorial can be found in the `ThermalModelTools` folder of the repository as a Jupyter notebook named `RepositoryTutorial.ipynb`.

This page will also describe some of the basic functions and methods for reference.
