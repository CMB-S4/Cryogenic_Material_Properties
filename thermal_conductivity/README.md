Within this folder you will find the code and python jupyter notebooks needed to analyze and compile the thermal conductivity data.

To fit the data:

```
fit_data.py
```

To see the different fit types:
```
fit_types.py
```

To manually add a fit from an external source:
```
manual_add.ipynb
```

To scrape thermal conductivity fits from the NIST website (Note this should not need to be run unless the NIST webstie has been recently updated):
```
NIST_scrape.py
```

To make plots of all the materials:
```
material_plots.py
```
