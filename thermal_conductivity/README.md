Within this folder you will find the very helpful jupyter notebook titled 
```
thermal_conductivity_tutorial.ipynb
```

In it, you will find a documented method for going from RAW thermal conductivity data to the combined fits file. Many of the necessary functions are stored in the tc_utils.py file and must be imported into the notebook before running.
