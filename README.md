# Cryogenic_Material_Properties
Compilation of material properties at cryogenic temperatures for use in design and testing of cryogenic systems.

This Git Repository will serve to store the RAW thermal conductivity and other material properties data, compiled from decades of published resources, and analysis tools (in Python) for streamlined use and analysis.

The repository is being actively developed by Dr. Nicholas Galitzki and graduate students at the University of Texas.
